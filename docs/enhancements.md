1. We need full support for multiple projects.  This should include a configuration page to create, update, delete a project.  The project should have attributes like name, ticket number prefix, owner.  On the tickets page you need to be able to filter by project.  Tickets would be numbered by PREFX-Number insted of SS-Number.  Ideally ticket numbers would start at 1 for a project and increment for just the project.
2. We need to be able to have drop downs from users and map an account from the username to the user.  (i.e. the _SYSTEM account in IRIS can me mapped to "Joe" and that be displayed in the drop down.   Only accounts mapped will show up in the drop downs for assigning users to a ticket.  The filter for users own tickets will filter based on it.
3. Once number 2 is implemented, we need to allow user selection through the MCP.  Each call related to tickets (updating them, commenting on them, etc.) should allow the AI agent to select a user.  That way we can have the AI be a user that is a different account than the one set up for that particular IRIS user they log in as.
4.  We need closed tickets to not appear in the list in the UI, except when a new "Closed" filter is selected.  There should be an option in the MCP tool that lists tickets to either include or exclude closed tickets in the list returned.
